- This program generates a game where the character is tracked by an arcball cam and
the objective is to avoid the enemies coming at you and to walk on every tile to turn
it green then you will grow and kill the enemies and win. If you get touched by the enemies
too much you will shrink and lose. If you fall off the map you also lose. If the enemies
collide they will turn into one big enemy and blue.
- How to run the program is to compile and run the code after updating the CmakeLists
correctly and once it is running you can move the hero forward or backward in its
heading using w or s in that order. You can also change the rotation of the hero
with the keys a and d to turn him left or right. To change the camera you just use
the mouse left click and dragging to rotate it. To zoom in you just hold r and
to zoom out you just hold f. I used the ArcballCam class.
for this.
- There isn't any known bugs anymore.
- This assignment took me probably about 12 hours but a lot of that was trying to
fix stupid bugs from making little mistakes.
- The lab really helped me for this assignment 10.
- This assignment was super fun and cool, and I would give it a 10.
